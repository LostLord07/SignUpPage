# SignUpPage

1. This is a normal signup page which just includes the usage of basic CSS concepts and HTML;
2. To make those gradient circles around the signup form I used border-radius property in square divs
    and to bring out the gradient color I set background = gradient(to top left, #color1, #color2);
